# Cricscore
CricScore is an Android app built in Java using Android Studio that enables real-time cricket scoring with two-innings support. It uses an SQLite database to store match details, toss results, innings data, and summaries. The app also supports multi-language localization (English, Hindi, Gujarati) for a broader user base.
